**Aegis** is a modern macOS desktop application that provides secure end-to-end message encryption using a hybrid RSA-AES design.   It combines the speed of symmetric AES encryption with the robust key exchange and digital signature capabilities of RSA.

## ‚ú® Features

- üß† **Automatic key generation and storage** using the macOS Keychain  
- üîê **Hybrid encryption** (AES-GCM + RSA-OAEP)  
- üñãÔ∏è **Digital signatures** with RSA-PSS for message integrity  
- üìé **Base64-encoded JSON envelope** for easy sharing  
- üí¨ **Clean SwiftUI interface** only two buttons: *Encrypt* and *Decrypt*  
- üíæ **Local key management** no servers, no data collection

## üì¶ Installation

### üç∫ Option 1: Install via Homebrew *(recommended)*

You can install **Aegis** directly from your terminal using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):

```bash
brew tap khalidt/aegis
brew install --cask aegis
```

Homebrew will automatically download, verify, and place **Aegis.app** in your `/Applications` folder.

> üõ°Ô∏è First launch and macOS Security Note:
Since Aegis is distributed outside the Mac App Store, macOS Gatekeeper may display a warning the first time you open it.
Just go to System Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security ‚Üí Allow Anyway, or right-click ‚Üí Open to trust the app.

To update later:

```bash
brew upgrade --cask aegis
```

To uninstall completely:

```bash
brew uninstall --cask aegis
```
---

### üíæ Option 2: Download manually

Download the latest version of **Aegis** from the [Releases page](https://github.com/khalidt/Aegis/releases):

1. Download the latest **Aegis-vX.X.X-app.zip** or **Aegis-vX.X.X.dmg** file.  
2. Unzip it, you‚Äôll see **Aegis.app**.  
3. Drag it into your **Applications** folder.

---

### üßë‚Äçüíª Option 3: Build from source in Xcode

If you‚Äôd like to build **Aegis** yourself:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/khalidt/Aegis.git
cd Aegis
open Aegis.xcodeproj
```

In **Xcode**:
1. Open `Aegis.xcodeproj` in **Xcode** (macOS 15).
2. Select the **Device** scheme.
3. Choose target ‚ÄúAny Mac (Apple Silicon, Intel)‚Äù.
4. Build and run (`‚åòR`). (Go to **Product ‚Üí Build** or **Product ‚Üí Run**.)

Or build via Terminal:

```bash
xcodebuild -project Aegis.xcodeproj \
           -scheme Device \
           -configuration Release \
           -destination 'platform=macOS' \
           build
```

Your compiled app will appear under:
```
~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/.../Build/Products/Release/Aegis.app
```

## üß© How It Works

### Encryption
1. A random 256-bit AES key is generated.
2. The plaintext is encrypted using **AES-GCM**.
3. The AES key is encrypted using **RSA-OAEP** with the recipient‚Äôs public key.
4. The ciphertext is signed using **RSA-PSS** with the sender‚Äôs private key.
5. The resulting Base64 JSON envelope is ready to share.

### Decryption
1. The recipient decrypts the AES key with their RSA private key.
2. The AES-GCM ciphertext is decrypted to recover the plaintext.
3. The sender‚Äôs signature is verified for authenticity.

## üßÆ Algorithm Summary

| Purpose | Algorithm |
|----------|------------|
| Key generation | RSA-4096 |
| Symmetric encryption | AES-256-GCM |
| Asymmetric wrapping | RSA-OAEP-SHA256 |
| Digital signature | RSA-PSS-SHA256 |
| Key fingerprint | SHA-256 |

---

## üß± Architecture

- **Swift 5 + SwiftUI**
- **CryptoKit** : for AES-GCM encryption
- **Security framework** : for RSA keypair management and signing
- **AppKit** : for Keychain access and About panel
- **macOS 15+** : native UI

---

## üóùÔ∏è Security Model

- Private keys are generated and stored inside the **macOS Keychain**.
- AES keys are ephemeral, generated per message and never reused.
- Signatures verify both message integrity and sender authenticity.
- The app does **not** connect to any external server or API.

## üßæ Example of Decrypted Envelope (message)

```json
{
  "alg": "RSA-OAEP-256 + AES-GCM + RSA-PSS-256",
  "nonce": "a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8",
  "enc_key": "Base64(...)",
  "ciphertext": "Base64(...)",
  "signature": "Base64(...)"
}

```
